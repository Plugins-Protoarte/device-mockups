# Device Mockups

> Simplify your mockups. Device Mockups generates shortcodes that display screenshots of your content in a responsive device.

## Description

Show your work in high resolution mockup shortcodes. Wrap your images or YouTube or Vimeo videos in different device wrappers. There's also a simple dropdown in the editor to help select what device you would like to use. The devices will respond to the container it's in and will look great on mobile.
